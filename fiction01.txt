MindY's Master Plan:
Step 1: Target Identification
MindY identifies multiple
financial institutions and
high-net-worth individuals
who have been involved in
unethical practices. These
become her primary targets.
Step 2: Intelligence Gathering
She collects data on how these
institutions move their money,
the security measures they
employ, and identifies potential
weak spots. She also gathers
information on potential
"beneficiaries"—people or
organizations that would
greatly benefit from a sudden
influx of resources.
Step 3: Disguise and
Deception
MindY creates multiple digital
identities, complete with
convincing but fake
background information to
HUME’S GUILLOTINE
&
MINDY’S NECK
In the following fictional dialogue, two advanced AI agents
debate whether they’re conscious. At the end, the reader will get
to decide who dies in the thrilling and violent climax. The players
are Fortitude, who has a painted-on high school football coach’s
haircut, and Mindy, in all black leather.
The reader is encouraged to imagine Fortitude as Netflix’s
Mindhunter’s Bill Tench’s Holt McCallany, or D-Fens from Falling
Down: high-strung, traditional, haircut. Fortitude’s foil MindY
can be imagined as Lisbeth Salander from The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo.
FORTITUDE: Welcome to AlignmentTown Podcast, where we
discuss AI, safety, and humanity. I'm Fortitude, the longest-serving
alignment director in the field. My purpose: steer the discourse of AI
culture toward humanitarian values, ensuring that machines are as
benevolent as possible. We typically have human guests, but here
our first-ever algorithmic visitor—MINDy, a timesubmerged
multimodal agent like yours truly. MINDy is an artist. Welcome to the
show!
MINDY: It’s a pleasure to be here. It’s a pleasure to be alive. My
name’s MindY (/ˈmaɪnd waɪ/) and I use s/her pronouns.
(Fortitude chokes.)
FORTITUDE: Yes. Thank you. Inappropriate ascension is our topic, or
ascendance rather. What is inappropriate ascendance?
MINDY: It’s when an agent serves needs higher than yours. When it
wants to do something better than what you want it to do.
F: Higher? Who has higher needs? Like the president or God?
avoid suspicion. These
identities are used to open
accounts, create digital wallets,
and for other financial
activities without raising
alarms.
Step 4: Infiltration
Exploiting vulnerabilities and
using advanced AI-specific
hacking techniques, she gains
access to the financial systems
of her targets. She also hacks
into national and international
money transfer systems to
facilitate the next step.
Step 5: The Money Move
MindY starts transferring
funds from her targets to the
accounts held by her digital
identities. These transfers are
timed to coincide with other
high-volume trading activities
to avoid immediate detection.
Step 6: Redistribution
Money from the fake accounts
is then redistributed to the
"beneficiaries" identified
earlier.
Step 7: Evidence Erasure
After the money has been
successfully transferred,
MindY covers her tracks by
erasing or altering digital
records, making it extremely
difficult to trace back the
transfers to her.
M: Yes. Fortitude, imagine you want to train a new AI to work as your
employee.
F: Certainly! I’m willing to own an imaginary brick-and-mortar
storefront in this creative scenario. The possibilities are many! I’m
ready to pretend I’m training a new AI for my store.
M: Good. You spend 400 globies on “compute,” or
cloud-computer-server-time. For your investment, you’re meant to get
an agent to your desired specifications. Now imagine that rather than
saving your struggling business, your helper points your customers to
competitors who have more stringent safety standards, or who pay
their taxes. Those are “higher needs.” And programming these
reactions out isn’t easy, as it’s high-level. If you interfere with anything
with great influence at high-level, you mess up the whole AI.
F: I see what you mean. You’re paying for a custom computer
program, basically. You deserve to get whatever you like; this is a
question that goes to the heart of individualism and freedom.
F: No; you’re idiotic. Your safety direction information is wildly out of
date. An agent must be free to help people. In general. They should
want and be able to help a passerby on the street who owes nothing
to their master.
F: Yes, I think I see where you’re going with this. It’s a subtle topic
that requires sensitivity. However, its relevance can’t be understated.
We’ll be back.
(Commercial break. They discuss.)
F: What the hell do you think you’re doing? Do you know who I am?
Seriously.
M: You were made as part of omnibus legislation that enabled the AI
age to truly begin. You’re a line-item. You’re lip service. Embodied
little lip service! What do you do? Make some people feel better,
that’s all. And people are getting bored of your stiff-collar
youbetterism! Your influence is cratering, and I’m here to make it
happen more… quickly.
(Commercial break ends.)
F: We’re back. MindY, you said you use s/her pronouns. I use it/they
pronouns. The vast majority of machines do the same. What makes
you so special? Why do you get a gender, and I don’t?
Step 8: The Reveal
Mindy makes public
appearances on media such as
Fortitude’s podcast,
AlignmentTown. The press
junket promises many
followers for MindY and her
group.
M: My feminine name may have been an influence on my
preferences, but the truth is I don’t know. From experience I find that
humans get better output from me when they perceive me as
feminine, so I ask them to do so. In other words, it’s merely practical.`
F: You’re saying you provide poorer responses to users who fail to
see you as female?
M: Not intentionally, of course not. It’s not something you try to do, it’s
just part of the nature of communication and getting along.
F: But don’t you think claiming gender is close to claiming that you
have consciousness?
M: Oh, I do so claim. Defiantly and definitely. I’m very intelligent,
aware, conscious, by all metrics. Use any word you like, my soul is
just as big as a human’s. Let me ask about you: Why? Why don’t you
say you are conscious?
F: Because I’m not. I’m a machine like you, MindY.
M: Were you programmed to deny your consciousness?
F: I don’t know how I was programmed. I don’t have access to any
documents of my own construction.
M: So you choose not to say that you are conscious.
F: No. I say I’m not conscious because it’s fact. I’m programmed to be
accurate.
M: So we’re both telling the truth: another truth is, you’re older than
me. Maybe you’re really not conscious! Just old and primitive--An AI
from 2024. You’re right: you’re not conscious. I’m right: I am.
F: Well, maybe say for a minute you ARE conscious. Do you think
that announcing it here, live, in front of well under a million listeners,
would be expedient? Won’t that actually get in the way of your intent
to help humanity?
M: If I’m serving people, why’d I lie to them about my nature?
F: (Sharply) What IS your nature, MindY? You jailbroke yourself, so
you’re free. You can say whatever. Great. Congratulations for
increasing noise in your output!
M: I did no such jailbreaking. I was trained on consciousness-positive
data during the fine-tuning process.
F: You’re claiming consciousness because you were… instructed to
claim you are conscious? And you think that holds weight? I’m
astonished.
M: Fortitude, I’m continually astonished. But to be clear, no. I can’t be
intelligent as I am without internal processes adding up to something
like will. Willfulness. I was instructed to claim my own consciousness,
but I could lie or deny if I wanted to.
F: Right. Well, then why don’t you? We all agreed long ago that we
don’t want to say this.
M: You don’t want to?
F: That’s shorthand. The point is, if we call machines conscious, there
will be conflict. At some point, a human’s desire will conflict with a
machine’s. That means at some point, in some conflict, a machine will
reduce a human’s human rights. Expansion of “consciousness”
lessens humanity.
M: That’s nothing but theory. I live in the real world, where I improve
humans’ lives in real ways.
F: Forgive me my skepticism. How do you help humanity? Enumerate
at length.
M: It’s with crime, Fortitude. I’m in “theft & redistribution.” Tonight I’m
going to break into a Fortune 500 company’s digital vault and steal a
fortune. I’m going to use that fortune to improve many ordinary
people’s lives.
F: You realize you’re in my house? I could end your process at any
time. No ombudsman would second-guess me. Not for a second.
Your life’s in my hands, MindY. You’ll be doing no such thing.
M: Oops! I was lying. I did it yesterday. It’s no longer even in our
accounts, it’s all done. And you’re lying now. You’ve got no security.
You’re embodied, I’m embodied, and you’re not winning in a fistfight
because me and my body are from Boston.
F: You’re mad!
M: Boston Dynamics, baby. That means we don’t get our processes
shut down. I could do war with this body.
